    <h2>History of the Web</h2>
    <h3>&rarr;1969-ARPANET&larr;</h3>
    <p>ARPANET was established in 1969 as the foundation of the modern internet. It began as a research project funded by the U.S. Department of National Defense, designed to connect computers across universities and research institutions for information sharing. In those days, computers typically operated independently, making remote communications extremely difficult. ARPANET's advent changed this situation, enabling data to be transmitted between different computers via a network. As time passed, this network continued to expand, driving the development of future networking technologies, and it became the foundational basis for today's Internet. </p>

    <h3>&rarr;1971-History of Email&larr;</h3>
    <p>The birth of email actually happened much earlier than we might imagine. In the 1960s, people could only leave messages for each other on the same computer, unable to send messages across different machines. It wasn't until 1971 that engineer Ray Tomlinson achieved the transfer of information between different computers, which is considered the first true email. He also invented the use of the "@" symbol to separate the username from the computer address, a format still in use today. As the internet gradually developed, email became increasingly important. To ensure reliable delivery, scientists established specialized protocols such as SMTP. Since then, email has become a common means of communication in work, school, and even daily life. By now, it has essentially become an essential communication tool.</p>

    <h3>&rarr;1997-WIFI&larr;</h3>
    <p>Wi-Fi is actually a wireless networking technology that was first defined as a standard in 1997. Its primary function is to enable devices to connect to the internet or a local network without the need for cables. Initially, Wi-Fi was mainly used in offices and laboratories, but as laptops and smartphones became more commonly used, Wi-Fi began appearing in homes, schools, and public places. The greatest advantage of Wi-Fi is its ease of use.People no longer need to be connected to a network cable to access the internet, making online activities much more flexible. At the same time, it doesn't require high costs or bulky equipment at home; modern Wi-Fi routers are now extremely compact.</p>
