        <td>Auriea Harvey is an artist producing simulations and sculptures that bridge physical and digital space. After plumbing the depths of net art and video games, she turned her attention to 3D modeling, printing, and mixed reality. Her work consists of sculptures that blend digital and handmade production. Launched in 1995, Entropy8 is a landmark in the history of net art, epitomizing Harveys vision of the internet as a viable platform for born-digital artworks. At a time when artist pages made up a significant portion of the nascent web, Harvey stood out by audaciously resisting browser limitations.<a href="https://artbase.rhizome.org/wiki/Q16154">source citation</a> </td>

The random progression of sounds and images creates torn, nonsensical statements. For a non-Japanese speaker the flow appears as an endless monologue, revealing itself in a form of sonic portraiture. The images were produced by degrading video to 1-bit stills and animating them.<a href="https://artbase.rhizome.org/wiki/Q3225">source citation</a> </td>

<h2>Characteristics of Early Web Art </h2>

<ul>
    <li>Interactivity and Participation</li>
                <ul>
                <li>Early internet art required the viewer to become a participant, often transforming passive browsing into active engagement. Works were rarely static; they were designed to be clicked, manipulated, or altered by the user, making the audience a part of the creative process.</li>
            </ul>

        </li>


<ul>
    <li>Immateriality and Virtual Existence</li>
                <ul>
                <li>Unlike traditional art, early internet art often existed only in the digital realm, defying physicality and traditional gallery structures. It lived as code on servers, HTML, and browser windows, emphasizing a "non-object" or ephemeral quality.</li>
            </ul>

        </Li>

<ul>
    <li>Networkability and Connectivity</li>
                <ul>
                <li>The art was often distributed and social, relying on email lists, web browsers, and hyperlinks to create a "networked" experience. This enabled
        global reach and fostered collaboration, as seen in projects shared across distributed, international communities.</li>
            </ul>
    
        </li>



    <li>Use of "Web 1.0" Aesthetics and Code</li>
                <ul>
                <li>Artists often used the raw tools of the early internet—basic HTML code, browser frames, glitch aesthetics, and early graphic user interfaces—
as their medium. Examples include the chaotic, anti-aesthetic, and deconstructive work of collective JODI, which treated code and error
messages as art.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>


    <li>Subversion of Institutions and Commercialism</li>
                <ul>
                <li>Early internet art often held a "utopian," democratic ethos, aiming to bypass traditional art galleries, museums, and market structures. It was
        often created by enthusiasts and artists operating outside conventional commercial art systems.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
