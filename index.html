    <p>Hi, I’m Cuiyi Wu, but you can call me Hailey. I am a junior student at media major and I am very interested in photography, editing, and design. I thoroughly enjoy the creative process because I believe both filming and editing are ways of telling stories, and I love storytelling. At the same time, I define myself as someone with ideas and creativity. That's why I'm more interested in things related to creative coding and visual design, because I believe visuals can convey my ideas more clearly than words. I've learned a little bit of HTML design and created a website filled with my ideas.</p>
